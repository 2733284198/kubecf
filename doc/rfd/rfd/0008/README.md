# RFD 0008 Public Roadmap

In the KubeCF repository, there's a new project named *Roadmap* where we track the features that we
are working, which phase they are and when they may come available.

This way, we can give the community a glimpse to our main features, the problem that they solve and how
they will solve it.

Questions and/or comments on any of the features can be added directly to the feature GitHub issue
itself.

## Guideline

## Phases

Every project feature has it's own lifecycle.

* Beta: public available but for testing and gather feedback.
* GA: public available.

Some features may be allocated to a desired timeframe, but still in exploratory phases, which can
lead to potential delays, since their main purpose is to gather community feedback.

* in design: we have decided to build but still figuring out how.
* exploring: we are considering building, but we need more feedback to make a final decision.

## Stages

The roadmap is arranged in quarters columns to give an idea when is our intention to release that
particular feature.

We also have two labels: *in design* or *exploring* which in conjunction with the timeframe column
can indicate how far are we with that particular feature and it may give a better sense if it can be
released within the initial timeframe.

## Disclaimer

This roadmap does not represent any commitment, promise or obligation to deliver any feature or any
feature on a particular date. The main goal is to give the community the team high level development
plan, so please do not rely on this roadmap to make any internal decision.
