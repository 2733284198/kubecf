# RFD 0008 Public Roadmap

## Motivation

The *Roadmap* project can be used used to track the features that the team decided to engage with,
which phase they are in and when they may come available.

The goal is to provide the community with a glimpse of our main features to come, the problem(s)
that they are solving and how the team is planning to implement them.

## Guideline

## Submit the features

New features are not added directly to the *Roadmap* project but instead added as an issue into the
*KubeCF* default project with the label *Type: Enhancement*.

Note: when opening a new issue please do not forget to use the correct template.

## Phases

Every project feature has it's own lifecycle.

* Beta: publicly available but only for testing and to gather feedback.
* GA: Publicly available.

Some features may be allocated to a timeframe (Q1, Q2,...) but with an exploratory label.
The purpose is to gather community feedback and it can lead to potential delays.

* In design: While we have decided to build this, we are still figuring out how to implement it.
* Exploring: While we are considering to build this, we need more feedback before making the final decision.

Any feature can be abandoned by team decision independently of its state, followed by a
well-documented reason.

## Stages

The roadmap is arranged in columns, each representing a quarter year, and it indicates when we
intent to release a feature.

We also have two labels: *in design* or *exploring* which in conjunction with the timeframe column
can indicate how far are we with that particular feature. This may provide a better sense if
released within the initial timeframe.

## Disclaimer

This roadmap does not represent any commitment, promise or obligation to deliver any feature or any
feature on a particular date. The main goal is to show the community the team's high level development
plan, so please do not rely on this roadmap to make any internal decision.
