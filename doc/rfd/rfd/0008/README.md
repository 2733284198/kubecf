# RFD 0008 Public Roadmap

## Motivation

The *Roadmap* project can be used used to track the features that the team decided to engage to,
which phase they are and when they may come available.

The goal is to provide to the community a glimpse to our main features, the problem that they're
solving and how the team is planning to solve.

## Guideline

## Submit the features

New features aren't added directly to the *Roadmap* project but instead added as an issue into the
*KubeCF* default project with the label *Type: Enhancement*.

Note: when opening a new issue do not forget please use the right template.

## Phases

Every project feature has it's own lifecycle.

* Beta: public available but for testing and gather feedback.
* GA: public available.

Some features may be allocated to a desired timeframe but still in exploratory phases, which can
lead to potential delays, since their main purpose is to gather community feedback.

* in design: we have decided to build but still figuring out how.
* exploring: we are considering building, but we need more feedback to make a final decision.

Any feature can be abandoned by team decision independently of its state, followed by a
well-documented reason.

## Stages

The roadmap is arranged in quarters columns to give an idea when is our intention to release that
particular feature.

We also have two labels: *in design* or *exploring* which in conjunction with the timeframe column
can indicate how far are we with that particular feature. This may provide a better sense if
released within the initial timeframe.

## Disclaimer

This roadmap does not represent any commitment, promise or obligation to deliver any feature or any
feature on a particular date. The main goal is to give the community the team high level development
plan, so please do not rely on this roadmap to make any internal decision.
